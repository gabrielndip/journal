**2024-11-29**   

I have 6 hours to make today count
I have to change some definitions to affect my last half of the day positively.

I have to evaluate and check my competition career-wise

I have to keep the path of least resistance

If it is hards, then it is about definitions; stop --> revise --> change --> execute

I am created to know and worship God; I am powerless and poor.
Service to humanity is worship; work is service; service is worship.
The greatest prayer is that of His Praise & Glorification.
I have to maintain a state of prayer throughout the day.
I have to check upcoming activities and actions in the community.
